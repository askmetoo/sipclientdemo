Patch #1: 

* Reference: 
    https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/Using_SIP_TCP 
    http://pjsip.pjsip.narkive.com/He87zFvS/unsupported-transport

[quote]
As the error says, the error is not permanent, as PJSIP will send the request anyway with UDP.

This TCP switching feature can be disabled as follows:

    at run-time by setting pjsip_cfg()->endpt.disable_tcp_switch to PJ_TRUE.
    at-compile time by setting PJSIP_DONT_SWITCH_TO_TCP to non-zero 

You can also tweak the 1300 threshold by setting PJSIP_UDP_SIZE_THRESHOLD to the appropriate value. 
[/quote]

* How to fix: add ";transport=tcp" to URI.

acc_cfg.id = "sip:6003@A.B.C.D"
acc_cfg.reg_uri  = "sip:A.B.C.D;transport=tcp"
acc_cfg.proxy = [ "sip:A.B.C.D;transport=tcp;lr" ]
realm = "asterisk"
username = "6003"
passwd = "**********"

========================

Error #2:
